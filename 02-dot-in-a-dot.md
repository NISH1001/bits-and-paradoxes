## A Dot In A Dot?
1. [Naming The Universe](https://aeon.co/essays/how-gods-beat-astronomers-in-the-solar-system-name-game)

> History of conflicts of naming "heavenly"(as they say) bodies.
> It's amazing how same results are obtained independently by independent observers without having any interaction with each other's existence.

2. [YouTube: Leonard Susskind: Quantum Mechanics, String Theory and Black Holes | Artificial Intelligence Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s78hvV3QLUE)
> It's always fascinating to hear Susskind. Loved listening to this one.

3. [WBH: The Great Battle of Fire and Light - The Power Games](https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/08/fire-light.html)
> This is the part 1 of the series by WBH.  

4. [YouTube: How to Tell Matter From Antimatter | CP Violation & The Ozma Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Elt0Gt9Cb6Q)

> This video is about the Ozma problem of distinguishing the chirality (ie left-handedness or right-handedness) of matter using weak interaction processes like beta decay (for example in uranium), or neutral kaon/k-meson decay. This is wrapped up in the phenomenon of CP violation, by which charge and parity are both violated by certain weak interaction processes - this enables antimatter to be unambiguously distinguished from matter, and left handed chirality from right handed.


> In this particular part, it dives (in a very layman way like WBH does every time) into the **genes** as a nature's software, 
and animals as a container/host for those genes.  
> This makes so much sense once you've read [The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2920622699). 

5. [Three Questions that Keep Me Up at Night](https://blog.evjang.com/2020/04/three-questions-that-keep-me-up-at-night.html)
> I think one should have few questions that keep them up at night.  
> First, it makes you aware of your own "self" and the universe.  
> Second, it makes you go to the places that you might not otherwise. 
> A rabbit-hole of information you will get to consume and feel more anxious!

6. [YouTube: Roger Penrose: Physics of Consciousness and the Infinite Universe | AI Podcast #85 with Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orMtwOz6Db0)
> This has been one of the most relaxed and insightful conversations in the series.  
> I love how penrose is humble, and articulated even at the age of 90 years.  
> The conversation jumps from philosophy of time, space, conciousness, learning and much.

7. [YouTube: Ann Druyan: Cosmos, Carl Sagan, Voyager, and the Beauty of Science | AI Podcast #78 with Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jFdxd1qX2g)
> This is an exciting conversation, partly because Ann and Carl were couples and that their relationship was a cosmic phenomenon.  
> The anecdotes Ann presented about their life, the power of science, the making of the **Cosmos** series and such were insightful.  
> I'd say, this was a great conversation to listen to without much technical details in the process.  
> This can be seen through Ann's enthusiasm for going into topic much deeper philosophically.

8. [Life is Made of Unfair Coin Flips](https://alexdanco.com/2020/04/09/life-is-made-of-unfair-coin-flips/)
> It's always fascinating to read about entropy from another perspective...

9. [Antifragility](https://alexdanco.com/2020/03/12/antifragility/)

10. [At the limits of thought ](https://aeon.co/essays/will-brains-or-algorithms-rule-the-kingdom-of-science)

> "Science today stands at a crossroads: will its progress be driven by human minds or by the machines that we’ve created?"  

> "Understanding is the means by which we overcome a world of paradox and illusion by opening up the black box of knowledge to modification."

11. [Physicists Criticize Stephen Wolfram’s ‘Theory of Everything’](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/physicists-criticize-stephen-wolframs-theory-of-everything/)
> Stephen has come up with his own computational view of universe. However, he is getting backfired.

12. [50 Ideas That Changed My Life](https://www.perell.com/blog/50-ideas-that-changed-my-life)

- "The structure of our social media feeds blinds us to history, as it causes us to live in an endless cycle of ephemeral content consumption. The structure of the Internet pulls people away from age-old wisdom..."

- "The world always makes sense. But it can be confusing. When it is, your model of the world is wrong. So, things that don’t make sense are a learning opportunity. Big opportunities won’t make sense until it’s too late to profit from them."

- **Hormesis:** A low dose of something can have the opposite effect of a high dose. A little bit of stress wakes you up, but a lot of stress is bad for you. Lifting weights for 30 minutes per day is good for you, but lifting weights for 6 hours per day will destroy your muscles. Stress yourself, but not too much.
