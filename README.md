## All Things Coding and Computer Engineering

#### Coding
1. [Change complex code](https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/a-process-to-do-safe-changes-in-a-complex-codebase/)

> Proxies and brokers.
> Don't replace everything at once.
> Add new code with same old functionality. Replace old code piece by piece like Ship of Theseus. It will have less domino effect of bugs.

2. [New developer old code](https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/is-it-to-the-newer-developer-to-pay-back-others-technical-debt/)

3. [Avoid rewriting a legacy system from scratch, by strangling it](https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/avoid-rewriting-a-legacy-system-from-scratch-by-strangling-it/)

4. [How To Write The Perfect Pull Request](https://github.blog/2015-01-21-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request/)

5. [A journey to searching Have I Been Pwned database in 49μs (C++)](http://stryku.pl/poetry/okon.php#a-journey-to-searching-have-i-been-pwned-database-in-49-microseconds)

> Searching using optimal algorithm and data structure. 
> It's weird how in normal cases we don't even consider worst case scenario and just let the algorithm be. 
> But data structures and search algorithms do matter in performance critical domains.

6. [What's so hard about PDF text extraction?](https://www.filingdb.com/pdf-text-extraction)

> This makes sense for me at the moment. 
> Having been working as a computer vision engineer ~coughs~ (over-estimation of the post), PDFs are pain in the ass....

7. [Text Processing In Shell](https://blog.balthazar-rouberol.com/text-processing-in-the-shell)
> The shell can be one of the powerful tools you can use if you are to be comfortable with CLI.

#### Computer Engineering Gores

1. [Requirements volatility is the core problem of software engineering](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/02/20/requirements-volatility-is-the-core-problem-of-software-engineering/)

2. [Why are we so bad at software engineering?](https://www.bitlog.com/2020/02/12/why-are-we-so-bad-at-software-engineering/)
> Partly because it's obscured and non-deterministic.
> "Non-deterministic" in a sense, a simple change can have unforeseen consequences and inherent bugs.
> Also the goals keep on changing constantly.
> Problems with scaling, keeping with temporal values and such.

3. [Please re-add original author to docs and license #1703](https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/1703)
> Hacker News Thread: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22523814

> This is an interesting issue in open-source. The original creator of **Guake** was not listed on the later-contributed-by-community continuation of the project. 

> It also showcases the healthy discussion between the intellectuals.

4. [Data Engineering How To](https://github.com/adilkhash/Data-Engineering-HowTo)
> List of relevant resources for data engineering.

5. [When to assume neural networks can solve a problem](https://blog.cerebralab.com/When_to_assume_neural_networks_can_solve_a_problem)

> [Almost certainty] If other ML models already solved the problem.


> [Very high probability] If a similar problem has already been solved by an ML algorithm, and the differences between that and your problem don’t seem significant.


> [High probability] If the inputs & outputs are small enough to be comparable in size to those of other working ML models AND if we know a human can solve the problem with little context besides the inputs and outputs.


> [Reasonable probability] If the inputs & outputs are small enough to be comparable in size to those of other working ML models AND we have a high certainty about the deterministic nature of the problem (that is to say, about the inputs being sufficient to infer the outputs).

6. [Cognitive Biases In Software Development](http://smyachenkov.com/posts/cognitive-biases-software-development/)
> We seem to cling to patterns we are familiar with. That applies to software development too. Patterns in programming...

7. [YouTube: Why build an entire computer on breadboards?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCbAafKLqC8)
> I love how Ben interprets the underlying complex phenomena into simple and understandable manner. 
> This specific video demonstrates the pros and cons of building an entire computer on a breadboard. 
> At higher signal frequency, the noises kick in due to more inductance and capacitance on the board which in low frequency signal otherwise might not be observed.  



#### Unix Ultimate
1. [Unix Toolbox](http://cb.vu/unixtoolbox.xhtml)

2. [How is the Linux kernel tested?](https://embeddedbits.org/how-is-the-linux-kernel-tested/)
> Interesting. Tests have their own set of planes in themselves.

#### Docker
1. [Reducing Image Size](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2020/02/docker-images-part1-reducing-image-size.html)

---

## A Dot In A Dot?
1. [Naming The Universe](https://aeon.co/essays/how-gods-beat-astronomers-in-the-solar-system-name-game)

> History of conflicts of naming "heavenly"(as they say) bodies.
> It's amazing how same results are obtained independently by independent observers without having any interaction with each other's existence.

2. [YouTube: Leonard Susskind: Quantum Mechanics, String Theory and Black Holes | Artificial Intelligence Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s78hvV3QLUE)
> It's always fascinating to hear Susskind. Loved listening to this one.

3. [WBH: The Great Battle of Fire and Light - The Power Games](https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/08/fire-light.html)
> This is the part 1 of the series by WBH.  

4. [YouTube: How to Tell Matter From Antimatter | CP Violation & The Ozma Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Elt0Gt9Cb6Q)

> This video is about the Ozma problem of distinguishing the chirality (ie left-handedness or right-handedness) of matter using weak interaction processes like beta decay (for example in uranium), or neutral kaon/k-meson decay. This is wrapped up in the phenomenon of CP violation, by which charge and parity are both violated by certain weak interaction processes - this enables antimatter to be unambiguously distinguished from matter, and left handed chirality from right handed.


> In this particular part, it dives (in a very layman way like WBH does every time) into the **genes** as a nature's software, 
and animals as a container/host for those genes.  
> This makes so much sense once you've read [The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2920622699). 

5. [Three Questions that Keep Me Up at Night](https://blog.evjang.com/2020/04/three-questions-that-keep-me-up-at-night.html)
> I think one should have few questions that keep them up at night.  
> First, it makes you aware of your own "self" and the universe.  
> Second, it makes you go to the places that you might not otherwise. 
> A rabbit-hole of information you will get to consume and feel more anxious!

6. [YouTube: Roger Penrose: Physics of Consciousness and the Infinite Universe | AI Podcast #85 with Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orMtwOz6Db0)
> This has been one of the most relaxed and insightful conversations in the series.  
> I love how penrose is humble, and articulated even at the age of 90 years.  
> The conversation jumps from philosophy of time, space, conciousness, learning and much.

7. [YouTube: Ann Druyan: Cosmos, Carl Sagan, Voyager, and the Beauty of Science | AI Podcast #78 with Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jFdxd1qX2g)
> This is an exciting conversation, partly because Ann and Carl were couples and that their relationship was a cosmic phenomenon.  
> The anecdotes Ann presented about their life, the power of science, the making of the **Cosmos** series and such were insightful.  
> I'd say, this was a great conversation to listen to without much technical details in the process.  
> This can be seen through Ann's enthusiasm for going into topic much deeper philosophically.

## Life - A Hodgepodge of Love and Tragedy

1. [ From first kiss to unfollowing – culture that sums up love in 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/feb/13/from-first-kiss-to-unfollowing-culture-that-sums-up-love-in-2020)

2. [Lean On](https://longreads.com/2019/02/05/lean-on/)
> I could resonate on this particular topic on whole another level.  
  
> Heartfelt. Contemplating. Leaning on. 
> We seem to lean on certain things, certain conenctions and attachments..in many ways we can only begin to realize about. 
> Self-reliance is a must I agree. But, one cannot truly live in his/her own solitude, right? 
> There's should be some companionship that creates compassion and emotions that blend into the perceived reality of oneself...
> Lean on...

3. [David Foster Wallace Disease](https://hazlitt.net/longreads/david-foster-wallace-disease)
> It's good that David has influenced so much of people around...not in a "classification" manner like "good" or "bad"...but in a more artistic way that seems to resonate with people that are in depressed state...in a more subtle way that's not nonchalant....

4. [The Anxiety Algorithm](https://www.adamjuliangoldstein.com/blog/anxiety-algorithm/)
> "I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it." - Nelson Mandela  

> Reading this write-up made so much sense not only on the startup/tech stack but on life itself. 
> Anxieties are "ways" for imaginations, most of which are pretty on the dark side I guess.
> Fear is a feature of anxiety that kept our ancestors safer, so all of us feel anxious sometimes.

5. [The Pleasures and Pains of Coffee](http://blissbat.net/balzac.html)  
> Damn. I truly know this particular feeling. Drinking coffee feels like a hopeless situation of hope and tragedy...

> "The state coffee puts one in when it is drunk on an empty stomach under these magisterial conditions produces a kind of animation that looks like anger: one's voice rises, one's gestures suggest unhealthy impatience: one wants everything to proceed with the speed of ideas; one becomes brusque, ill-tempered about nothing"

6. [Inside David Foster Wallace's Private Self-Help Library](https://www.theawl.com/2011/04/inside-david-foster-wallaces-private-self-help-library/)

> "Humility — the acceptance that being human is good enough — is the embrace of ordinariness."  

> The love his admirers bear this author has a peculiarly intimate and personal character. This is because Wallace gave voice to the inner workings of ordinary human beings in a manner so winning and so truthful and forgiving as to make him seem a friend.  

> Wallace seemed always to be trying to erase the distance between himself and others in order to understand them better, and trying visibly to make himself understood — always asking questions, demanding to know more details. 

7. [One Big Idea](https://www.perell.com/blog/one-big-idea)

> This is a short and concise write-up by David. Like he has mentioned in the article: `In my pursuit, I’m guided by the famous words of Bruce Lee: "I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.” `

8. [Freeman Dyson - Why I don't like the PhD system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzC1IRYN_Ps)
> For me it's personally relatable since I don't quite have long attention span to focus on one thing for a very long time.  

9. [Being basic as a virtue](https://nadiaeghbal.com/basic)
> This hits hard and quite close to me. :)

10. [My Friend Mister Rogers](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/12/what-would-mister-rogers-do/600772/)
> I can't even imagine a person like Fred Rogers. He was a fascinating person I guess. And this article gives a perspective from the writer, 
a life-long friend of Rogers, who interviewed him and turned into a deeply emotional relationship.

11. [Can you say...Hero?](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a27134/can-you-say-hero-esq1198/)

12. [The Price of Discipline - David Perell](https://www.perell.com/blog/the-price-of-discipline)
> "It's no accident, I think, that tennis uses the language of life. Advantage, service, fault, break, love, the basic elements of tennis are those of everyday existence, because every match is a life in miniature."

13. [The Top Idea in Your Mind](http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html)
> "You can't directly control where your thoughts drift. If you're controlling them, they're not drifting. But you can control them indirectly, by controlling what situations you let yourself get into."


14. [Letter to myself in late 2008](https://dalton.substack.com/p/letter-to-myself-in-late-2008)

15. [YouTube: The Strangest Secret in the World by Earl Nightingale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UygnXqoKrC4)  
15. [Text Version](https://livesensical.com/podcast/change-your-life/strangest-secret/)

> "We become what we think about."

> Earl Nightingale was an American radio speaker and author, dealing mostly with the subjects of human character development, motivation, and meaningful existence.

> Earl Nightingale message is incredible here and we highly recommend listening to it and following some of the awesome traits Earl lays out in detail.

> This is an inspiring speech by Nightingale. It's one of the best wisdom that anyone can get.


16. [The Woman Who Lives 200,000 Years in the Past ](https://www.outsideonline.com/2411125/lynx-vilden-stone-age-life)
> Truly amazing woman, Lynx!

## Health
1. [The Next Outbreak? We're not ready](https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_the_next_outbreak_we_re_not_ready)
> Bill Gates is pretty thoughtful and mindful. He is an intellect who (from my perspective) tries to see things from wider perspective through his knowledge and mental models.  
> This is one of the "better" talks I have watched and it's so true that the world isn't prepared to pandemics.  

> We think are ready for any thing. We were ready to buckle up for war between countries, inside a country, separatists propaganda, 
and so much I can't jolt down here.  

> But here's the thing, we are never ready for new kind of viruses, a new form of epidemic. Partly because viruses are complex, mutable. 
> And partly because we can't truly quarantine such entities. And because they grow exponentially in some forms. It takes time to reach a stale growth, the upper flat side of a sigmoid curve. It just takes time and we don't have enough mentality to avoid new viruses. 

> That's why we have never thought of preparing for such outbreak despite being cautioned by researchers time and again of possible outburst. 
> Perhaps, we all are cognitively bias to refer to new type of viruses as simple flus, with relatively small number of deaths initially. 
> But then when it grows and gets out of hand, that's when we realize it has already begun and we haven't still prepared ourselves. 
> That's the truth I guess.

2. [How we must respond to the COVID-19 pandemic | Bill Gates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe8fIjxicoo)
> Like his talk from 2015, Bill keeps on emphasizing how we should proceed for testing kits/tool that are cheaper, help private sectors and be more precationary.

## Music
1. [How I recorded an album on my own, in my room](https://medium.com/@rodrigo.m.mesquita/what-i-learned-recording-an-alternative-album-on-my-own-in-my-room-c440b8201c9)
> I wish I could have same level of perseverance as that of the author. This is truly an inspiring write-up.

2. [YouTube: Light in Babylon - Baderech El Hayam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hHfAan74ek)
> I recently discovered this band. 
> I have been listening to some exotic music that reflect native culture through their instruments, vocals and spirit.  


>  "A celebration of the cosmopolitan traditions of both Istanbul and the Sephardic Jewish community and another example of the great music that is coming out of the Eastern Mediterranean right now." - fRoots Magazine  


> This specific song is hewbrewish. The title translates to **On The Way To The Sea**. The translation of the song goes something like this:  


> A pair of busty eyes  
> A pair of similar eyes  
> They tell me why they can't  
> And be happy  
> 
> Waiting life  
> Life gift  
> Escape from here for over a year  
> To another country  
> 
> On the way to the sea  
> I didn't prepare for that  
> May call me there   
> In her erotic voice  
>  
> Talked about the Creator  
> And I could see  
> Sometimes it exists  
> In the neurotic world  


> I think it's beautiful and should be felt to (not just listened).

## History
1. [History of Empty Places](https://www.recordnepal.com/perspective/the-history-of-empty-places/)

> Places tolerate us.
> For natives and local residence, same places mean different values.
> For outside observers, it's a matter of great "research" topic about culture and evolution of the place.
> For writer, it's more affine towards emotional aspect -- more articulated feelings.

## Poetry
1. [YouTube: "Hir" Poem about trangsgendered youth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRLSgPQG0c4)
> This gave me goosebumps.

2. [Shachar Avakeshcha](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/513b9fc4e4b0b5df0ebd941d/t/56ab8747be7b9686b0172693/1454081863473/Shachar+Avakeshcah.pdf)
> "This  poem  was  written  by  the  great  poet  and  philosopher  Rabbi  Solomon  Ibn  Gabirol  during  the  11th century. The Piyut opens with a statement  of time  - the  dawn. This leads into a description  of the  light as a differentiator, creating  and  renewing  things,  giving  them  their  form  and volume. At  this hour,  daybreak, the poet chooses to request an audience with his  God, between  the uncertainty of the night and the fullness of the dawn. The poet is searching  for  the light that will clarify, explain, and differentiate the things as God did during the creation of the world."

## Learning and Thought Processes
1. [Using Models to Stay Calm in Charged Situations](https://fs.blog/2020/03/models-charged-situations/)

2. [Build Stuff](https://why.degree/motivation/)
> Build stuff. Don’t just study stuff, build stuff!

3. [Ask HN: What do you use to keep track of bookmarks/notes/snippets?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22778123)
> Few things I have been experimenting (using) on:  

> (a) [pocket](getpocket.com/): My go-to platform for saving articles to be read later.  

> (b) [evernote](evernote.com/): I mostly dump my broken thoughts here.  

> (c) [zotero](https://github.com/zotero/zotero): Currenly experimenting on this. Seems promising.  

> (d) [Meta: bits-and-paradoxes](https://github.com/NISH1001/bits-and-paradoxes): Compiling some contents I have liked here.  

> (e) [Notion](https://www.notion.so/): People say it's very good. I haven't got my hands dirty with this.  

> (f) [Memex](https://github.com/WorldBrain/Memex): I had been using this on-off. But I ditched it since it was having a toll on the CPU in my firefox browser.
