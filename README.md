## All Things Coding and Software Engineering

#### Coding
1. [Change complex code](https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/a-process-to-do-safe-changes-in-a-complex-codebase/)

> Proxies and brokers.
> Don't replace everything at once.
> Add new code with same old functionality. Replace old code piece by piece like Ship of Theseus. It will have less domino effect of bugs.

2. [New developer old code](https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/is-it-to-the-newer-developer-to-pay-back-others-technical-debt/)

3. [Avoid rewriting a legacy system from scratch, by strangling it](https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/avoid-rewriting-a-legacy-system-from-scratch-by-strangling-it/)

4. [How To Write The Perfect Pull Request](https://github.blog/2015-01-21-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request/)

5. [A journey to searching Have I Been Pwned database in 49μs (C++)](http://stryku.pl/poetry/okon.php#a-journey-to-searching-have-i-been-pwned-database-in-49-microseconds)

> Searching using optimal algorithm and data structure. 
> It's weird how in normal cases we don't even consider worst case scenario and just let the algorithm be. 
> But data structures and search algorithms do matter in performance critical domains.

#### Software Engineering Gores

1. [Requirements volatility is the core problem of software engineering](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/02/20/requirements-volatility-is-the-core-problem-of-software-engineering/)

2. [Why are we so bad at software engineering?](https://www.bitlog.com/2020/02/12/why-are-we-so-bad-at-software-engineering/)
> Partly because it's obscured and non-deterministic.
> "Non-deterministic" in a sense, a simple change can have unforeseen consequences and inherent bugs.
> Also the goals keep on changing constantly.
> Problems with scaling, keeping with temporal values and such.

#### Unix Ultimate
1. [Unix Toolbox](http://cb.vu/unixtoolbox.xhtml)

#### Docker
1. [Reducing Image Size](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2020/02/docker-images-part1-reducing-image-size.html)

## Pale Blue Dot?
1. [Naming The Universe](https://aeon.co/essays/how-gods-beat-astronomers-in-the-solar-system-name-game)

> History of conflicts of naming "heavenly"(as they say) bodies.
> It's amazing how same results are obtained independently by independent observers without having any interaction with each other's existence.

## Life - A Hodgepodge of Love and Tragedy
1. [ From first kiss to unfollowing – culture that sums up love in 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/feb/13/from-first-kiss-to-unfollowing-culture-that-sums-up-love-in-2020)

## History
1. [History of Empty Places](https://www.recordnepal.com/perspective/the-history-of-empty-places/)

> Places tolerate us.
> For natives and local residence, same places mean different values.
> For outside observers, it's a matter of great "research" topic about culture and evolution of the place.
> For writer, it's more affine towards emotional aspect -- more articulated feelings.
