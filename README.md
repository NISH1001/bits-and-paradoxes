# Bits and Paradoxes

All things I loved consuming to reinforce my prior beliefs of the world around.

## All Things Coding and Software Engineering

#### Coding
1. [Change complex code](https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/a-process-to-do-safe-changes-in-a-complex-codebase/)

> Proxies and brokers.
> Don't replace everything at once.
> Add new code with same old functionality. Replace old code piece by piece like Ship of Theseus. It will have less domino effect of bugs.

2. [New developer old code](https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/is-it-to-the-newer-developer-to-pay-back-others-technical-debt/)

3. [Avoid rewriting a legacy system from scratch, by strangling it](https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/avoid-rewriting-a-legacy-system-from-scratch-by-strangling-it/)

4. [How To Write The Perfect Pull Request](https://github.blog/2015-01-21-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request/)

5. [A journey to searching Have I Been Pwned database in 49μs (C++)](http://stryku.pl/poetry/okon.php#a-journey-to-searching-have-i-been-pwned-database-in-49-microseconds)

> Searching using optimal algorithm and data structure. 
> It's weird how in normal cases we don't even consider worst case scenario and just let the algorithm be. 
> But data structures and search algorithms do matter in performance critical domains.

6. [What's so hard about PDF text extraction?](https://www.filingdb.com/pdf-text-extraction)

> This makes sense for me at the moment. 
> Having been working as a computer vision engineer ~coughs~ (over-estimation of the post), PDFs are pain in the ass....

#### Software Engineering Gores

1. [Requirements volatility is the core problem of software engineering](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/02/20/requirements-volatility-is-the-core-problem-of-software-engineering/)

2. [Why are we so bad at software engineering?](https://www.bitlog.com/2020/02/12/why-are-we-so-bad-at-software-engineering/)
> Partly because it's obscured and non-deterministic.
> "Non-deterministic" in a sense, a simple change can have unforeseen consequences and inherent bugs.
> Also the goals keep on changing constantly.
> Problems with scaling, keeping with temporal values and such.

3. [Please re-add original author to docs and license #1703](https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/1703)
> Hacker News Thread: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22523814

> This is an interesting issue in open-source. The original creator of **Guake** was not listed on the later-contributed-by-community continuation of the project. 

> It also showcases the healthy discussion between the intellectuals.

4. [Data Engineering How To](https://github.com/adilkhash/Data-Engineering-HowTo)
> List of relevant resources for data engineering.

#### Unix Ultimate
1. [Unix Toolbox](http://cb.vu/unixtoolbox.xhtml)

#### Docker
1. [Reducing Image Size](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2020/02/docker-images-part1-reducing-image-size.html)

## Pale Blue Dot?
1. [Naming The Universe](https://aeon.co/essays/how-gods-beat-astronomers-in-the-solar-system-name-game)

> History of conflicts of naming "heavenly"(as they say) bodies.
> It's amazing how same results are obtained independently by independent observers without having any interaction with each other's existence.

## Life - A Hodgepodge of Love and Tragedy

1. [ From first kiss to unfollowing – culture that sums up love in 2020](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/feb/13/from-first-kiss-to-unfollowing-culture-that-sums-up-love-in-2020)

2. [Lean On](https://longreads.com/2019/02/05/lean-on/)
> I could resonate on this particular topic on whole another level.  
  
> Heartfelt. Contemplating. Leaning on. 
> We seem to lean on certain things, certain conenctions and attachments..in many ways we can only begin to realize about. 
> Self-reliance is a must I agree. But, one cannot truly live in his/her own solitude, right? 
> There's should be some companionship that creates compassion and emotions that blend into the perceived reality of oneself...
> Lean on...

3. [David Foster Wallace Disease](https://hazlitt.net/longreads/david-foster-wallace-disease)
> It's good that David has influenced so much of people around...not in a "classification" manner like "good" or "bad"...but in a more artistic way that seems to resonate with people that are in depressed state...in a more subtle way that's not nonchalant....

4. [The Anxiety Algorithm](https://www.adamjuliangoldstein.com/blog/anxiety-algorithm/)
> "I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it." - Nelson Mandela  

> Reading this write-up made so much sense not only on the startup/tech stack but on life itself. 
> Anxieties are "ways" for imaginations, most of which are pretty on the dark side I guess.
> Fear is a feature of anxiety that kept our ancestors safer, so all of us feel anxious sometimes.

5. [The Pleasures and Pains of Coffee](http://blissbat.net/balzac.html)  
> Damn. I truly know this particular feeling. Drinking coffee feels like a hopeless situation of hope and tragedy...

> "The state coffee puts one in when it is drunk on an empty stomach under these magisterial conditions produces a kind of animation that looks like anger: one's voice rises, one's gestures suggest unhealthy impatience: one wants everything to proceed with the speed of ideas; one becomes brusque, ill-tempered about nothing"

6. [Inside David Foster Wallace's Private Self-Help Library](https://www.theawl.com/2011/04/inside-david-foster-wallaces-private-self-help-library/)

> "Humility — the acceptance that being human is good enough — is the embrace of ordinariness."  

> The love his admirers bear this author has a peculiarly intimate and personal character. This is because Wallace gave voice to the inner workings of ordinary human beings in a manner so winning and so truthful and forgiving as to make him seem a friend.  

> Wallace seemed always to be trying to erase the distance between himself and others in order to understand them better, and trying visibly to make himself understood — always asking questions, demanding to know more details. 

7. [One Big Idea](https://www.perell.com/blog/one-big-idea)

> This is a short and concise write-up by David. Like he has mentioned in the article: `In my pursuit, I’m guided by the famous words of Bruce Lee: "I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.” `

8. [Freeman Dyson - Why I don't like the PhD system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzC1IRYN_Ps)
> For me it's personally relatable since I don't quite have long attention span to focus on one thing for a very long time.  

9. [Being basic as a virtue](https://nadiaeghbal.com/basic)
> This hits hard and quite close to me. :)

## History
1. [History of Empty Places](https://www.recordnepal.com/perspective/the-history-of-empty-places/)

> Places tolerate us.
> For natives and local residence, same places mean different values.
> For outside observers, it's a matter of great "research" topic about culture and evolution of the place.
> For writer, it's more affine towards emotional aspect -- more articulated feelings.
