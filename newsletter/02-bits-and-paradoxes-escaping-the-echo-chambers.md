# **Introduction**

 Hi Folks,
It's been more "locked up" week with new cases increasing rapidly in Kathmandu. I hope everyone's safe and is healthy (physically and mentally).

I had been becoming more anxious lately during the past two weeks. So, I decided I'd be filtering out even more information I consume in echo chambers. As a result, I permanently deleted my Instagram and Twitter accounts for good. I've always felt that these things were making me more and more anxious. It might not be the same as you. But for me, it was. So, now for some time, I won't be interacting in any echo chambers. I'd rather have confirmation bias with my own filter bubble and spend time consuming relevant information. I know I might get (metaphorically) something like [Phantom Limb Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_limb#Phantom_limb_syndrome). But yeah! That's fine.

Also, I learned about [Streisand Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect) -- a social phenomenon that occurs when an attempt to hide, remove, or censor information has the unintended consequence of further publicizing that information, often via the Internet.

## [Building A Second Brain In Roam](https://www.reddit.com/r/RoamResearch/comments/eho7de/building_a_second_brain_in_roamand_why_you_might/)

- I've been using Roam in my daily life for 3 weeks now. And it's going well. Although it's more like "organized chaos", it's becoming effective for me to compile all my thoughts into this seamless platform. Let's see if I get [[Information Overload]] or not.
- "The goal of these applications -- and the concept of the Second Brain in general -- is to create a system that takes the **maze** out of your head and places it within a trusted reservoir of knowledge **outside your brain**. The goals are two-fold:"
- "To get the knowledge out of your head and stored safely, so information is
not forgotten and no energy is exerted trying to remember it."
- "To have a system that helps you process and understand these **previously missed** connections. Something that helps you create novelty out of individual packets of knowledge."
- "If necessary, you can rearrange your Shortcut links by un-starring a page and then re-starring it after another page."
- "^^"[[Knowledge]], I think, is highly informal. It's contingent. It is fluid. It is very context-dependent, so it doesn't make sense to spend time on all of that. It's really like just doing barely enough to get it through those stages of capturing, organizing, distilling so then you can start expressing."^^ - [[Tiago Forte]]"
- "The OP's methods of using Roam is something like:"
- "Use [[PARA System]] structure:"
    - "Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives"
    - "Collect everything under these tags or links"
- "Collect everything in daily notes."
    - "This timestamps everything"
- "The main idea is to seamlessly use daily notes page to build the knowledge base. "

## [When In human history did we start cutting our hair?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/gh2c1d/when_in_human_history_did_we_start_cutting_our/)

- This was fairly new information I consumed about history of hair styling.
- "**muddying** "
- "one of the oldest hair styling techniques"
    - "still used by African tribes"
    - "no tools required"
- "**evidence of braids**"
- "30000 years ago - Austria"
    - "[Venus of Willendorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_of_Willendorf)"
- "25000 years ago"
    - "[Venus of Brassempouy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_of_Brassempouy)"
- "still difficult from where the styling started as a culture"
- "**burning**"
- "might be from same era when fire was first discovered"
- "no sophisticated tools required"
- "^^some evidence of the tools and body ornamentation happening there was related to [[Neanderthals]]^^"
- "**hair combs**"
- "Africa around 5000 BCE"
- "fairly lifestyle inferred using [[Peptide Mass Fingerprinting]]"
- "Papua New Guinea natives cutting/trimming hair with blades made from bamboo, sharpened with stone"

## [Ask HN: How to stop anxiety from too many choices?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23131966)

- I think this is relatable to more people. The OP's direct sentiment is:
    - "__The obvious answer here is to reduce choices. However the past few months I am struggling hugely with anxiety which is rendering me incapable on some days to make any real progress on my goals; startup, learning & side projects.

When the pandemic began, and we lost our clients I have found myself in a constant state of ideation and future thinking, but once I start one of these (semi-pivots) I get worried that there is a better idea and go back to the drawing board.__"
- " It doesn’t have to be the number of choices creating anxiety. Maybe an existing anxiety is pushing you towards seeing more choices to block yourself from committing on one, because you are too internally conflicted."
- "**If you are too nervous about something because it all matters too much, then start with some throwaway thing that is related that you won't mind if it turns out a mess.**"
- "#[[My Favorite]]"
    - "My advice is to lower the value of ideas. A lot of time people think, "If only I had a good idea I would be successful". "
    - "You will see other people saying things like, "Buy my good idea!". "
    - "But really, good ideas are a dime a dozen. Good ideas, bad ideas... it actually doesn't make much difference. What makes the difference is execution and timing."

# **Listening/Watching**

## [Ryan Hall: Value of Competition | Take It Uneasy Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94MBVD_tZeU)

- I totally loved this motivating thought from Ryan Hall -- "An American black belt and instructor in Brazilian [[Jujitsu]], and a professional mixed martial artist."
- "__"Proper preparation and proper focus and dedication over the long haul yields positive results. Most importantly, it's about how we are conducting ourselves in an honorable and respectable manner. I believe that competition really teaches us that."__ - #Quotes #[[My Favorite]]"
- "Trying hard means honest self-analysis."

- ## **Highlights**
    - "Mathematica to Stephen Wolfram as Telescope to Galileo"
    - "Simple rules give rise to complex behaviour"
    - "New to understanding"
        - "He had to create [[A New Kind of Science]]" -- "__ With patience, insight, and self-confidence to spare, Wolfram outlines a fundamental new way of modeling complex systems.__ — via [A New Kind of Science by Stephen Wolfram | Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/238558.A_New_Kind_of_Science) [[+Roam]]"
    - "Systematizing knowledge and make it more computable"
    - "**Around Timstamp 00:07:00** - Insane demo of [[Wolfram Alpha]]"
- "#[[My Thoughts]]"
    - "I haven't really got into Stephen Wolfram's mind before. Now it feels I was missing out one of the greatest minds out there in the 21st century."
    - "This was good to listen to, especially how the platform Wolfram Alpha has turned out a decade later. It's a computational mind in itself."
    - "His enthusiasm could be seen through the synergy he produced throughout the talk."
    - "But as I am writing this, he is getting totally backfired by the physics community on his theory of everything like Eric Weinstein is getting.

## [The Rememberer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hS_AXRRnIzM)
- The turtle guy, [[exurb1a]], is back (one of my favorite YouTube channels) with this new video almost after 3 months. Just the kind of existential crises I 
needed.
- ^^I’m sure we’ve all been through that phase when you 
just want to make 30 minute thinly veiled monochrome allegories about 
your fear of ageing.^^

# **Ending Thoughts**
"__Seeing you one more time is also seeing you one less time.__ — via [Seeing you one more time is also seeing you one less time. : DeepThoughts](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/gjq12o/seeing_you_one_more_time_is_also_seeing_you_one/) [[+Roam]] #[[Deep Thoughts]] #Reddit #[[My Favorite]]"


I've been reading [[The Pleasure of Finding Things Out]]. I want to share this thought from [[Richard Feynman]]:  

> "__"You see one thing is, I can live with doubt and uncertainty and not knowing. I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong."__ - #[[Richard Feynman]] #[[My Favorite]]"


That's it. I hope you have your own "sense" of filtering mechanisms and consume relevant information. Make sure you’re practicing [[Information Mindfulness]] (a term I invented I guess.)

Cheers,  
Nish
