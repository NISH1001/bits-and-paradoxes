### [Article: Why Do We Even Listen To New Music](https://pitchfork.com/features/article/listen-to-music/)
- "Listening to new music is hard. Not hard compared to going to space or 
war, but hard compared to listening to music we already know."
- "I think people find it hard to get out of their comfort zone and the same applies to music too. Neurologically, the [[Neuroplasticity]] has its own perks -- the way we have been shaping our taste to some domain/genre of music, that in many ways constantly reframes our listening preferences, is a double-edged sword. "
- "I could (superficially) feel how it had been in 1913, during the premiere of Stravinsky's [[Music: The Rite of Spring]]. I could only have wild speculation from the audiences' perspective. And a similar situation could be applied to Stravinsky himself. This vaguely comes from our own experiences when a friend shares a piece of song or music to us and we feel hesitant to give it a listen on the first go. Nevertheless, we do. The first time, it might not have its charm. But then, listening to it in some different time frame and mood might let us taste what that particular new music holds inside. I guess we can experiment with a lot of our musical taste, and then time and again might end up with something that resonates with our soul."


### [Article: No one knew the world's worst problem so we spent 8 years trying to find it](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/world-problems/)
- What are the world’s biggest and most urgent problems?
- **The most urgent problems are those where people can have the greatest impact by working on them.**
- "**Why issues facing rich countries aren’t always the most important—and why charity shouldn’t always begin at home.**"
    "Someone living on the US [[Poverty Line]] of $11,000 per year is richer than about 85% of the world’s population, and about 20 times wealthier than the world’s poorest 1.2 billion, who mostly live in Africa and Asia on under $500 per year"
    "![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fnishparadox%2FE6LckeRwu8.png?alt=media&token=79e19356-d6e1-4e49-b007-ff088af05b63)"
    
- **Global Health**
    - "over the second half of the 20th century, progress on treatments for diarrhoea did as much to save lives as achieving world peace over the same period would have done"
    - "**The number of deaths each year due to diarrhoea have fallen by 3 million over the last four decades due to advances like oral rehydration therapy. **"
    - "**if we compare health in the US to global health, there is a 130-fold difference**"
    - "**a 10% donation would be equivalent to donating 1,000% of our income to charities focused on poverty in rich countries.**"
    - 
- **Why focusing on future generations can be even more effective than tackling global health**
    - "Which would you choose from these two options?

    - Prevent one person from suffering next year.
    - Prevent 100 people from suffering (the same amount) 100 years from now."
- **How to preserve future generations – find the more neglected risks**
- **Biorisk: The threat from future disease**
    "The chance of a pandemic that kills over 100 million people over the next century seems similar to the risk of nuclear war or runaway climate change."
- **Artificial intelligence and the ‘alignment problem’**
    "No-one knows how to code moral behaviour into a computer. Within computer science, this is known as the [[Alignment Problem]]."
- **Dealing with uncertainty, and "going meta"**
    - "Global priorities research"
    - "Broad interventions, such as improved politics"
    - "Capacity building and promoting effective altruism"
        - "If you’re uncertain which problems will be most pressing in the future, a
third strategy is to simply save money or invest in your career capital, so you’re in a better position to do good when you have more information"
- **How to work out which problems __you__ should focus on**
    - "We don’t think everyone should work on the number one problem. If you’re a great fit for an area, you might have over 10 times as much impact as in one that doesn’t motivate you. So this could easily change your personal ranking."
- **Apply this to your own career**
    "Write down the three global problems that you think are most pressing 
for you to work on."
    "For each problem, list out some specific career options you could take that would help the problem."

### [Article: When Music is Your First Language](https://lithub.com/when-music-is-your-first-language/)
- "Philip Kennicott is the chief Art and Architecture Critic of The Washington Post. Philip reflects some of his early experiences with an introduction to music and how his teachers have influenced his perspective on music."
- "I feel having someone to be there and inspire you matters a lot. For say, Philips's first teacher, Myfanwy, had made music fun. However, his second teacher, Charlotte, made it seem important, and she had introduced him to serious music, pieces that had weighty labels like “sonatina” and “invention” 
and “minuet.” Even in the unforeseen circumstances of life and family, Philip seemed to have realized music as his native language and kept on sticking to it thereto."

### [Book: Good Old Neon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49766169-good-old-neon)
- "I don't know how I should put my "experience" of reading this story. It's not just a story, but and "experience" that I could relate, personally, to whole another level."
- "I feel the whole story is a direct rip off from my own journal. The articulation from DFW, one of few people who have influenced me in profound ways, felt as if DFW found my own journal and converted my projection of "self" into the manifolds of the protagonist. Utterly, I felt the very essence of [[Fraudulence Paradox]] and the need for constant validation of oneself has a substantial way to reflect one's life. Most probably, having gone under depression myself (yes, clinical depression where I used to take medicines) and having multiple suicidal thoughts of not able to get validated enough, not able to find meaning among the absurdities, again I could scratch what DFW had felt."
- "Maybe, Good Old Neon made more sense for me than "The Depressed Person". There were times where DFW classic hyperbole could be seen, and perhaps that's what has influenced me profoundly. Maybe that's what **David Foster Wallace Disease** is."
- "The intro pretty much defines the whole argument of me getting connected uncannily to this piece from DFW:"
    > "My whole life I’ve been a fraud. I’m not exaggerating. Pretty much allI’ve ever done all the time is try to create a certain impression of me in other people. Mostly to be liked or admired. It’s a little more complicated than that, maybe. But when you come right down to it it’s to be liked, loved. Admired, approved of, applauded, whatever. You get the idea."

### [Eric Weinstein and Bret Weinsten - The Portal Episode 19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLb5hZLw44s)
- "The introduction becomes personal about Bret because being an older brother, Eric discloses how Bret was intertwined in the college with events related to racism and protest -- as a heroic professor against the "racist" insurgence at Evergreen State College. Bret was a biology teacher in the college. Eric tries to convey that mainstream media hadn't covered this event much. And that the event has the many-sided story from different groups and people. I am not sure I can put this paragraph nicely here though."
- "Timestamp 00:07:10"
    - "**Eric**: Can you quickly tell how the world has come recognize you?"
    - "**Bret**: Typically as a result of meltdown at Evergreen State College where I taught for 14 years. We faced amount of people who accused me of racism..."
- "Timestamp 00:26:50 - Conversation becomes awkward. Maybe Eric's "older brother" kicks in."
    - "Eric: This is really boring and interesting. It's like you're "mis-telling" me. This isn't even honest. I don't care about peer review and such. You're not being taken fully seriously as a biologist."
- "Timestamp 00:35:00 - Eric:"
    - "Why don't we have that in your podcast. I accept the invitation. This is my podcast. We will do it my way."
- "Timestamp 00:53:10 - [[Hayflick LImit]]"
- "Around Timestamp 01:10:10 "
    - "Bret discusses about his hypothesis about mice not having ultra long [[Telomere]] and that only lab mice have those longer ones."
    - "This makes me feel Bret knows his fields in-depth."
- "Around Timestamp 01:30:00"
    - "Eric, again, pours out his rage towards academic institution -- here it is abot peer review."

### [A Conversation with Igor Stravinsky, 1957](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJIXobO94Jo)
- "Igor Fyodorovich Stravinsky ComSE was a Russian composer, pianist, and conductor. He is widely considered one of the most important and influential composers of the 20th century. Stravinsky's compositional career was notable for its stylistic diversity."
- **Some Old Recordings I recommend**
- [Stravinsky In Rehearsal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3s_CbOjiiA)
- [Stravinsky conducts The Firebird, NY Phil. (final three scenes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrMGqAmjbug)

### [The Economics of Revolution and Mass Deception - The Portal Episode 04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzjqjU2FOwA)
- "Overall, the conversation happened around [[Preference Falsification]]"
- "This is a complex talk I couldn't really understand. It went too far more into politics and economics which I failed to contemplate. In some ways, I could understand a few things. But overall it's just a conversation between two adults about politics, religion, economics, Islam, the US and such."
- "From the YouTube comment: A really long conversation to explain [[Bandwagoning]] "

### [are you running from something?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e34JKz0sSiU)
- Being a big fan of Ramuna, I could resonate with this.
- This type of rendition is what I love about her. It kind of makes me connected and become more contemplative.

### [Flocking Behavior of Birds (Boids Algorithm) - Smarter Every Day 234](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LWmRuB-uNU)
- I am trying to implement this in panim. I guess I am procrastinating on this too.
- [original paper](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dt/siggraph97-course/cwr87/)
- The algorithm is simplified something like:
    - **fly towards the centre of the mass**
        - This kinda make everything collapse to singularity.
    - **avoid each other**
        - This makes sense.
        - It adds some realism to the simulation.
    - **try to match your velocity with the other bird**
        - each bird acting on a local region gives a way for global behaviour.

## **Fascinating Things I Discovered**

### [Ask HN: Name one idea that changed your life](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23092657)
> "Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through."

### [Firefox Addon: +Roam](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/roam/)
- This blends in nicely with roam.
- If you find some texts on the internet, use this addon to paste into roam.
- It will copy the text along with some metadata about source of the text.
- This way you don't have to manually think about adding source for the text.
