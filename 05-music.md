> I wish I could have same level of perseverance as that of the author. This is truly an inspiring write-up.

2. [YouTube: Light in Babylon - Baderech El Hayam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hHfAan74ek)
> I recently discovered this band. 
> I have been listening to some exotic music that reflect native culture through their instruments, vocals and spirit.  


>  "A celebration of the cosmopolitan traditions of both Istanbul and the Sephardic Jewish community and another example of the great music that is coming out of the Eastern Mediterranean right now." - fRoots Magazine  


> This specific song is hewbrewish. The title translates to **On The Way To The Sea**. The translation of the song goes something like this:  


> A pair of busty eyes  
> A pair of similar eyes  
> They tell me why they can't  
> And be happy  
> 
> Waiting life  
> Life gift  
> Escape from here for over a year  
> To another country  
> 
> On the way to the sea  
> I didn't prepare for that  
> May call me there   
> In her erotic voice  
>  
> Talked about the Creator  
> And I could see  
> Sometimes it exists  
> In the neurotic world  


> I think it's beautiful and should be felt to (not just listened).
