> "This  poem  was  written  by  the  great  poet  and  philosopher  Rabbi  Solomon  Ibn  Gabirol  during  the  11th century. The Piyut opens with a statement  of time  - the  dawn. This leads into a description  of the  light as a differentiator, creating  and  renewing  things,  giving  them  their  form  and volume. At  this hour,  daybreak, the poet chooses to request an audience with his  God, between  the uncertainty of the night and the fullness of the dawn. The poet is searching  for  the light that will clarify, explain, and differentiate the things as God did during the creation of the world."
