> I could resonate on this particular topic on whole another level.  
  
> Heartfelt. Contemplating. Leaning on. 
> We seem to lean on certain things, certain conenctions and attachments..in many ways we can only begin to realize about. 
> Self-reliance is a must I agree. But, one cannot truly live in his/her own solitude, right? 
> There's should be some companionship that creates compassion and emotions that blend into the perceived reality of oneself...
> Lean on...

3. [David Foster Wallace Disease](https://hazlitt.net/longreads/david-foster-wallace-disease)
> It's good that David has influenced so much of people around...not in a "classification" manner like "good" or "bad"...but in a more artistic way that seems to resonate with people that are in depressed state...in a more subtle way that's not nonchalant....

> "The state coffee puts one in when it is drunk on an empty stomach under these magisterial conditions produces a kind of animation that looks like anger: one's voice rises, one's gestures suggest unhealthy impatience: one wants everything to proceed with the speed of ideas; one becomes brusque, ill-tempered about nothing"

> "Humility — the acceptance that being human is good enough — is the embrace of ordinariness."  

> The love his admirers bear this author has a peculiarly intimate and personal character. This is because Wallace gave voice to the inner workings of ordinary human beings in a manner so winning and so truthful and forgiving as to make him seem a friend.  

> Wallace seemed always to be trying to erase the distance between himself and others in order to understand them better, and trying visibly to make himself understood — always asking questions, demanding to know more details. 

7. [One Big Idea](https://www.perell.com/blog/one-big-idea)

> This is a short and concise write-up by David. Like he has mentioned in the article: `In my pursuit, I’m guided by the famous words of Bruce Lee: "I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.” `

a life-long friend of Rogers, who interviewed him and turned into a deeply emotional relationship.

12. [The Price of Discipline - David Perell](https://www.perell.com/blog/the-price-of-discipline)
> "It's no accident, I think, that tennis uses the language of life. Advantage, service, fault, break, love, the basic elements of tennis are those of everyday existence, because every match is a life in miniature."

13. [The Top Idea in Your Mind](http://www.paulgraham.com/top.html)
> "You can't directly control where your thoughts drift. If you're controlling them, they're not drifting. But you can control them indirectly, by controlling what situations you let yourself get into."

> This has been in my to-listen list for a long time now since I know (vaguely) who Eirc was. 
> Finally, I listened it with attention to what Eric and Peter Thiel had to contribute. 
> It was like two intellectuals, although separated by personal philosophy and dogma, were in this dance of thought processes 
that synchronized with each other. 
> Both, having respect for each other, were totally true intellectuals. 
> "Peter and Eric discuss the link between growth and violence and the need to rejoin the quest for a more energizing future for all levels of society."

19. [Why Is Joe Rogan So Popular?](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/08/my-joe-rogan-experience/594802/)

I had assumed him to be someone groking money and popularity. Boy... I was damn wrong. This man is his own Wikipedia... intellectual...a different kind. I'm glad that I've started to listen to his podcast...

> I am not sure if I can genuinely talk about this. I haven't had any chance to get into the mind of Parijat, how she viewed the world, and what even life and love meant to her? Is life even meaningful? I have many questions that often bombard my Mind-Cave.
