1. [The Next Outbreak? We're not ready](https://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates_the_next_outbreak_we_re_not_ready)
> Bill Gates is pretty thoughtful and mindful. He is an intellect who (from my perspective) tries to see things from wider perspective through his knowledge and mental models.  
> This is one of the "better" talks I have watched and it's so true that the world isn't prepared to pandemics.  

> We think are ready for any thing. We were ready to buckle up for war between countries, inside a country, separatists propaganda, 
and so much I can't jolt down here.  

> But here's the thing, we are never ready for new kind of viruses, a new form of epidemic. Partly because viruses are complex, mutable. 
> And partly because we can't truly quarantine such entities. And because they grow exponentially in some forms. It takes time to reach a stale growth, the upper flat side of a sigmoid curve. It just takes time and we don't have enough mentality to avoid new viruses. 

> That's why we have never thought of preparing for such outbreak despite being cautioned by researchers time and again of possible outburst. 
> Perhaps, we all are cognitively bias to refer to new type of viruses as simple flus, with relatively small number of deaths initially. 
> But then when it grows and gets out of hand, that's when we realize it has already begun and we haven't still prepared ourselves. 
> That's the truth I guess.

2. [How we must respond to the COVID-19 pandemic | Bill Gates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe8fIjxicoo)
> Like his talk from 2015, Bill keeps on emphasizing how we should proceed for testing kits/tool that are cheaper, help private sectors and be more precationary.
